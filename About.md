## Notes ##

  1. For some months i won't have a wii, so i have to test the app with dolphin emulator on pc:<br>that's the reason of the issues with rev23, ecc.<br>(damn, it was working seamlessly on the emu :)</li></ul>

I'd like to keep updating the app with fixes and new features, but i need feedbacks from 'real' wiis:<br>please report any bug (or suggestion!) here:<br><a href='http://code.google.com/p/wiibrowser/issues/list'>http://code.google.com/p/wiibrowser/issues/list</a>
